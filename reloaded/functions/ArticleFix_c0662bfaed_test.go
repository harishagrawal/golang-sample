/*
1. Test the function with "zyeoihZYEHIO" and check if the vowels are successfully changed.
2. Test the function with an array that contains only "\n" and check if the function returns the same array.
3. Test the function with an array where every single character is a vowel.
4. Test the function when the array string elements contain only consonants. Expect unchanged array.
5. Test the function with an array where each element starts with a vowel.
6. Test with an array where no element starts with a vowel.
7. Test the function with an array that contains all articles 'a' or 'A'. Check if it adds 'n' in every article.
8. Test the function with an array of mixed articles 'an' and 'AN'. Check if it removes 'n' from the articles.
9. Test the function with an array of articles in random order ['An','aN','a','AN','an'].
10. Test the function with an empty array and check if it returns an empty array.
11. Test the function with an array having letters other than English letters or special characters.
12. Test the function with an array of lower and upper case letters mixed with articles.
13. Performance Testing: Test the function with a very large sized array and analyze the function's performance.
14. Test the function with "null" array entries, to see how it handles null values.
15. Test the function with an array of numeric strings and special characters, to check its behavior with non-alphabetical or linguistic strings.
16. Test with an array where the 'a' or 'A' is in between the string, not at the start.
17. Test the function with an array having 'an' at the end of the string, not at the start.
18. Test the function with 'an' or 'AN' in between the strings and not at the start.
19. Test the function where 'a' or 'A' is followed by a string starting with vowel and not located at the start.
20. Test the function with 'an' followed by a string starting with consonant and not located at the start.
