Scenario 1: Normal operation with valid inputs

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function with valid inputs. The function is expected to return the index of the first non-newline, non-command string in the slice after the given index.
Execution:
    Arrange: We need to arrange a slice of strings with a mixture of newline, command, and regular strings, and a valid index.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndforw function with the arranged slice and index.
    Assert: Use Go's testing package to check if the returned index is correct.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the function's intended behavior of identifying the index of the first non-newline, non-command string in the slice after the given index. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly processes valid inputs and returns the expected output.

Scenario 2: Edge case with empty slice

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when provided with an empty slice. As there are no elements in the slice, the function is expected to return the initial index.
Execution:
    Arrange: Arrange an empty slice of strings and a valid index.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndforw function with the arranged slice and index.
    Assert: Use Go's testing package to check if the returned index is the same as the initial index.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when dealing with an empty slice. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases and does not produce any unexpected errors or results.

Scenario 3: Edge case with all newline and command strings

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when all the strings in the slice are either newline or command strings. The function is expected to return the length of the slice as there are no non-newline, non-command strings.
Execution:
    Arrange: Arrange a slice of strings with only newline and command strings and a valid index.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndforw function with the arranged slice and index.
    Assert: Use Go's testing package to check if the returned index is the same as the length of the slice.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when all the strings in the slice are either newline or command strings. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles such scenarios and returns the expected result.

Scenario 4: Error handling with string equal to "'"

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's error handling capabilities when it encounters a string equal to "'". In such a scenario, the function is expected to return -1.
Execution:
    Arrange: Arrange a slice of strings with a string equal to "'" and a valid index.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndforw function with the arranged slice and index.
    Assert: Use Go's testing package to check if the returned index is -1.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the function's expected behavior when encountering a string equal to "'". This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles such scenarios and returns the expected result.
