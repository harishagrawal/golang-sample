ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=CommandFix_b62ac95e0c

Scenario 1: Normal operation - CommandFix with valid input
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the CommandFix function. The input will be an array of strings that contain valid command names ('up', 'hex', 'bin', 'low', 'cap') enclosed in parentheses.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an array of strings that contain valid command names enclosed in parentheses.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the arranged array of strings.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array of strings is as expected - commands concatenated with their parameters, and command parentheses removed.
Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the CommandFix function correctly concatenates commands with their parameters and removes command parentheses. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly processes valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Edge case - CommandFix with empty input
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the CommandFix function handles an empty input array. The array contains no strings.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty array of strings.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the empty array.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array of strings is also empty.
Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the CommandFix function correctly handles an empty input array by returning an empty array. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Error handling - CommandFix with invalid input
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the CommandFix function handles an array of strings that contain invalid command names. The command names are not 'up', 'hex', 'bin', 'low', or 'cap'.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an array of strings that contain invalid command names.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the arranged array of strings.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array of strings is identical to the input array, as the invalid commands are not processed.
Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the CommandFix function correctly handles invalid commands by ignoring them. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle error scenarios.

Scenario 4: Edge case - CommandFix with input containing no commands
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the CommandFix function handles an array of strings that contain no command names. The strings are not enclosed in parentheses.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an array of strings that contain no command names.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the arranged array of strings.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array of strings is identical to the input array, as there are no commands to process.
Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the CommandFix function correctly handles inputs with no commands by returning the input unchanged. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases.
