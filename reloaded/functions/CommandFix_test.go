ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=CommandFix_b62ac95e0c

Scenario 1: Normal operation - CommandFix with valid input
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the CommandFix function. The input will be an array of strings that contain valid commands enclosed in parentheses.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a slice of strings that contain valid commands enclosed in parentheses.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the arranged slice.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly concatenates the commands and removes the parentheses. This is essential to ensure that the command processing works as expected.

Scenario 2: Edge case - CommandFix with empty input
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the CommandFix function handles an empty input. The input will be an empty slice of strings.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty slice of strings.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the arranged slice.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual result is an empty slice.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function returns an empty slice when the input is empty. This is important to ensure the function behaves correctly when no commands are provided.

Scenario 3: Error handling - CommandFix with invalid command
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the CommandFix function handles an invalid command. The input will be a slice of strings that contain an invalid command enclosed in parentheses.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a slice of strings that contain an invalid command enclosed in parentheses.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the arranged slice.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly ignores the invalid command and does not modify the input. This is essential to ensure that the function does not process invalid commands.

Scenario 4: Edge case - CommandFix with multiple valid commands
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the CommandFix function handles multiple valid commands. The input will be a slice of strings that contain multiple valid commands enclosed in parentheses.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a slice of strings that contain multiple valid commands enclosed in parentheses.
    Act: Invoke the CommandFix function with the arranged slice.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly concatenates all the commands and removes the parentheses. This is important to ensure the function can process multiple commands at once.
