Scenario 1: Testing Punc function with an array containing punctuations

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Punc function when provided with an array containing punctuations. The function is expected to append the punctuation to the previous string and remove the punctuation from the array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array with strings and punctuations.
    Act: Invoke the Punc function with the created array.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the array returned by the function matches the expected array.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the Punc function correctly appends the punctuation to the previous string and removes the punctuation from the array. This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with arrays containing punctuations.

Scenario 2: Testing Punc function with an array containing no punctuations

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Punc function when provided with an array containing no punctuations. The function is expected to return the array as it is.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array with strings and no punctuations.
    Act: Invoke the Punc function with the created array.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the array returned by the function matches the expected array.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the Punc function correctly returns the array as it is when no punctuations are present. This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with arrays containing no punctuations.

Scenario 3: Testing Punc function with an empty array

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Punc function when provided with an empty array. The function is expected to return an empty array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty array.
    Act: Invoke the Punc function with the created array.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the array returned by the function matches the expected array.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the Punc function correctly returns an empty array when provided with an empty array. This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with empty arrays.

Scenario 4: Testing Punc function with an array containing only punctuations

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Punc function when provided with an array containing only punctuations. The function is expected to return an empty array.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array containing only punctuations.
    Act: Invoke the Punc function with the created array.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the array returned by the function matches the expected array.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the Punc function correctly returns an empty array when provided with an array containing only punctuations. This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly with arrays containing only punctuations.
