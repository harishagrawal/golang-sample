Scenario 1: Valid String and Base Conversion

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly converts a valid string and base to an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a valid string and base. For example, AtoiBase("1010", "01").
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes. In this case, the expected outcome is 10.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should correctly convert the binary string "1010" to the decimal number 10. This test is important as it validates the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Invalid Base

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an invalid base.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a valid string and an invalid base. For example, AtoiBase("1010", "0").
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes. In this case, the expected outcome is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return 0 when the base is invalid. This test is important as it checks if the function correctly handles error cases.

Scenario 3: Invalid String

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an invalid string.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the function with an invalid string and a valid base. For example, AtoiBase("1020", "01").
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes. In this case, the expected outcome is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return 0 when the string is invalid. This test is important as it checks if the function correctly handles error cases.

Scenario 4: Base Contains Duplicate Characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a base that contains duplicate characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a valid string and a base that contains duplicate characters. For example, AtoiBase("1010", "001").
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes. In this case, the expected outcome is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return 0 when the base contains duplicate characters. This test is important as it checks if the function correctly handles error cases.

Scenario 5: Base Contains '+' or '-'

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a base that contains '+' or '-'.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke the function with a valid string and a base that contains '+' or '-'. For example, AtoiBase("1010", "01-").
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes. In this case, the expected outcome is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return 0 when the base contains '+' or '-'. This test is important as it checks if the function correctly handles error cases.
