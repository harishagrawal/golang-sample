Scenario 1: Valid String and Base

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to correctly convert a string to an integer based on the provided base. The string and base provided are both valid and should not result in any errors.

Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are involved.
Act: Invoke the target function with a valid string and a valid base.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected output for the given input. For example, calling AtoiBase("abc", "abc") should return 6. This test is important to confirm that the function works correctly under normal circumstances.


Scenario 2: Invalid Base

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to handle an invalid base. The base provided is less than 2 characters long, which should result in a return value of 0.

Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are involved.
Act: Invoke the target function with a valid string and an invalid base.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected output for the given input. For example, calling AtoiBase("abc", "a") should return 0. This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles invalid inputs.


Scenario 3: Base Contains Duplicate Characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to handle a base that contains duplicate characters. This should result in a return value of 0.

Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are involved.
Act: Invoke the target function with a valid string and a base that contains duplicate characters.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected output for the given input. For example, calling AtoiBase("abc", "aab") should return 0. This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles invalid inputs.


Scenario 4: Base Contains Invalid Characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to handle a base that contains invalid characters ('-' or '+'). This should result in a return value of 0.

Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are involved.
Act: Invoke the target function with a valid string and a base that contains invalid characters.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected output for the given input. For example, calling AtoiBase("abc", "ab-") should return 0. This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles invalid inputs.


Scenario 5: String Contains Characters Not in Base

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to handle a string that contains characters not present in the base. This should result in a return value of 0.

Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as no external dependencies are involved.
Act: Invoke the target function with a string that contains characters not present in the base and a valid base.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected output for the given input. For example, calling AtoiBase("abc", "ab") should return 0. This test is important to confirm that the function correctly handles invalid inputs.
