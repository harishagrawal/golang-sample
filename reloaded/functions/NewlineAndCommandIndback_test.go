Scenario 1: Testing with a non-empty array and positive index

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with a non-empty array and a positive index. The function should return the index of the last non-command and non-newline string in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array with a mix of command, newline, and other strings. Set the index to a positive value.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the initialized array and index.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns the correct index.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected functionality of the function, which is to return the index of the last non-command and non-newline string in the array. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in normal operation.

Scenario 2: Testing with a non-empty array and a negative index

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with a non-empty array and a negative index. The function should return -1 as there is no valid index in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array with a mix of command, newline, and other strings. Set the index to a negative value.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the initialized array and index.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns -1.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected functionality of the function, which is to return -1 when the index is negative. This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Testing with an empty array

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with an empty array. The function should return -1 as there is no valid index in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an empty array.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the initialized array and any index.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns -1.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected functionality of the function, which is to return -1 when the array is empty. This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Testing with an array containing only commands and newlines

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with an array containing only commands and newlines. The function should return -1 as there is no non-command and non-newline string in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array containing only commands and newlines.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the initialized array and any index.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns -1.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected functionality of the function, which is to return -1 when there is no non-command and non-newline string in the array. This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases correctly.
