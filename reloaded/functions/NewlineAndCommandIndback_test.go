Scenario 1: Testing with a non-empty array and positive index

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with a non-empty array and a positive index. The function should return the index of the last non-command and non-newline string in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array with a mix of command, newline, and other strings. Set a positive index.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the array and the index.
    Assert: Assert that the returned index is as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies the index of the last non-command and non-newline string. This test is important to ensure the function works properly in normal operation.

Scenario 2: Testing with a non-empty array and zero index

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with a non-empty array and a zero index. The function should return -1 as there are no previous indices to check.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array with a mix of command, newline, and other strings. Set the index to 0.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the array and the index.
    Assert: Assert that the returned index is -1.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the edge case of a zero index. This test is important to ensure the function behaves as expected in edge cases.

Scenario 3: Testing with a non-empty array and negative index

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with a non-empty array and a negative index. The function should return -1 as negative indices are not valid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an array with a mix of command, newline, and other strings. Set the index to a negative number.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the array and the index.
    Assert: Assert that the returned index is -1.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the edge case of a negative index. This test is important to ensure the function behaves as expected in edge cases.

Scenario 4: Testing with an empty array

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when provided with an empty array. The function should return -1 as there are no elements in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an empty array. Set any index.
    Act: Invoke the NewlineAndCommandIndback function with the array and the index.
    Assert: Assert that the returned index is -1.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the edge case of an empty array. This test is important to ensure the function behaves as expected in edge cases.
