/*
1. Test with a string including "(up)" and expect the IsCommand function to return true.
2. Test with a string including "(low)" and expect the IsCommand function to return true.
3. Test with a string including "(cap)" and expect the IsCommand function to return true.
4. Test with a string including "(bin)" and expect the IsCommand function to return true.
5. Test with a string including "(hex)" and expect the IsCommand function to return true.
6. Test with a string not including either "(up)", "(low)", "(cap)", "(bin)", or "(hex)" and expect the IsCommand function to return false.
7. Test with an empty string and expect the IsCommand function to return false.
8. Test with a string having two or more command in a string such as "(up)" and "(low)" and expect the IsCommand function to return true.
9. Test with a string having command word without brackets such as "up" but not "(up)" and expect the IsCommand function to return false.
10. Test with a string including a command embedded within another word, e.g "(backup)", and expect the IsCommand function to return false, because the command "up" is not present on its own.
11. Test with a string including multiple "up" commands, e.g "(up)(up)", and expect the IsCommand function to return true.
12. Test with a string where the commands are mixed case, e.g "(Up)", and expect the IsCommand function to return false, because the function is case-sensitive.
13. Test with a string where the commands are spaced, e.g "(u p)", and expect the IsCommand function to return false, as it should only match exact occurrences.
