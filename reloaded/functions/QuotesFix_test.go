ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=QuotesFix_08bb623535

Scenario 1: Normal operation with an array containing elements with single quotes.

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly processes an array of strings containing single quotes. The function is expected to remove these quotes and fix the strings.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an array of strings containing single quotes.
Act: Call the QuotesFix function with the created array as a parameter.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned array does not contain any strings with single quotes.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function has correctly removed and fixed the strings containing single quotes. This test is important because it verifies the function's basic functionality.

Scenario 2: Edge case with an array containing no elements with single quotes.

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an array that does not contain any strings with single quotes. The function is expected to return the array unchanged.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an array of strings without any single quotes.
Act: Call the QuotesFix function with the created array as a parameter.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned array is identical to the input array.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles arrays that do not require any processing. This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Edge case with an empty array.

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an empty array. The function is expected to return the empty array unchanged.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an empty array.
Act: Call the QuotesFix function with the empty array as a parameter.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned array is also empty.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles empty arrays. This test is important because it verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Error handling with a nil array.

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a nil array. The function is expected to return a nil array.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a nil array.
Act: Call the QuotesFix function with the nil array as a parameter.
Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned array is also nil.

Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles nil arrays. This test is important because it verifies the function's error handling capabilities.
