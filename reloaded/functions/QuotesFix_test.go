Scenario 1: Normal Operation with Balanced Single Quotes

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function works as expected when the array of strings contains balanced single quotes that is every opening quote has a closing quote.
Execution:
Arrange: An array of strings with balanced single quotes is created.
Act: The QuotesFix function is invoked with the array.
Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to check if the returned array is as expected.
Validation:
The assertion checks if every opening quote has been prefixed to the next string and every closing quote has been suffixed to the previous string as per the function's logic. This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Normal Operation with Unbalanced Single Quotes

Details:
Description: This test checks how the function behaves when the array of strings contains unbalanced single quotes that is there are opening quotes without corresponding closing quotes.
Execution:
Arrange: An array of strings with unbalanced single quotes is created.
Act: The QuotesFix function is invoked with the array.
Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to check if the returned array is as expected.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the opening quote has been prefixed to the next string and no changes have been made to the strings after the opening quote as there is no corresponding closing quote. This test is important as it checks how the function handles unbalanced quotes which might be a common occurrence.

Scenario 3: Edge Case with No Quotes

Details:
Description: This test checks how the function behaves when the array of strings contains no quotes.
Execution:
Arrange: An array of strings with no quotes is created.
Act: The QuotesFix function is invoked with the array.
Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to check if the returned array is identical to the input array.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function makes no changes to the array as there are no quotes. This test is important as it checks the function's behavior when there are no quotes, a possible edge case.

Scenario 4: Edge Case with All Strings as Quotes

Details:
Description: This test checks how the function behaves when all the strings in the array are quotes.
Execution:
Arrange: An array of strings where all strings are quotes is created.
Act: The QuotesFix function is invoked with the array.
Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to check if the returned array is as expected.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly prefixes and suffixes the quotes to the adjacent strings as per its logic. This test checks the function's behavior in an extreme case where all strings are quotes.
