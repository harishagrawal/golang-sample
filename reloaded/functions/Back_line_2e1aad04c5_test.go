/*
 1. Scenario: `arr` is an empty slice.
    Data: `arr = []` and `i = 0`.
    Expected outcome: Return `0`.

 2. Scenario: `arr` contains a single element without any special characters.
    Data: `arr = ["element"]` and `i = 0`.
    Expected outcome: Return `0`.

 3. Scenario: `arr` contains multiple elements without any special characters and `i = 0`.
    Data: `arr = ["apple","banana","cherry"]` and `i = 0`.
    Expected outcome: Return `0`.

 4. Scenario: `arr` contains multiple string data with special characters and `i` is less than the length of array.
    Data: `arr = ["apple","ban?ana","cher!ry"]` and `i = 2`.
    Expected outcome: It returns index `1` as it goes one step back.

 5. Scenario: `arr` contains elements with special characters and `i` is greater than the length of `arr`.
    Data: `arr = ["apple","ban?ana","cher!ry"]` and `i = 6`.
    Expected outcome: It should go back to valid index `2`.

 6. Scenario: `arr` contains multiple string data with special characters interspersed among non-special character strings and `i` is less than the length of array.
    Data: `arr = ["!","apple","?","banana","cherry"]` and `i = 2`.
    Expected outcome: It moves back and returns index `1`.

 7. Scenario: `arr` contains multiple strings, all with special characters and `i` is in the middle of the array.
    Data: `arr = ["!","@","#","$","%"]` and `i = 3`.
    Expected outcome: It will continue to move back till it reaches index `0`.

 8. Scenario: `arr` contains multiple strings, all without special characters and `i` is in the middle of the array.
    Data: `arr = ["apple","banana","cherry","date","elderberry"]` and `i = 3`.
    Expected outcome: It returns index `3` as this is a valid entry without special characters.

 9. Scenario: `arr` contains multiple string data, with every alternate string containing a special character and `i` is less than the length of array.
    Data: `arr = ["apple","!","banana","?","cherry"]` and `i = 2`.
    Expected: `back_line` is expected to return `0` which is the index of the last valid string "apple".

 10. Scenario: `arr` has a string with newline character in it
    Data: `arr = ["first line\n"]` and `i = 0`.
    Expected outcome: Return `0` as newline is considered a special character.

 11. Scenario: `arr` contains multiple strings, all containing a special character and `i=0`.
    Data: `arr = ["?", "!", "@"]` and `i = 0`.
    Expected Outcome: It returns `0` as we do not have any non-special characters strings before index `0`.

 12. Scenario: Negative value of `i`.
    Data: `arr = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` and `i = -3`.
    Expected outcome: Since there is a condition `j>0` before going into the loop, the loop would not be executed and `0` would be returned.
