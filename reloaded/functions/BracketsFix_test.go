Scenario 1: Normal operation with balanced brackets

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function with a basic input of balanced brackets. The function should be able to correctly process a balanced array of brackets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an array of balanced brackets strings.
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array is the same as the input array.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which should be able to process balanced brackets without altering the input array. This test is important to ensure that the function works correctly under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Unbalanced brackets

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function when the input array of brackets is unbalanced. The function is expected to fix the unbalanced brackets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an array of unbalanced brackets strings.
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array is balanced.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which should be able to fix unbalanced brackets. This test is crucial to ensure that the function can handle error conditions and still produce a correct output.

Scenario 3: Empty array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function when the input array is empty. The function should return an empty array in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty array.
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array is also empty.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which should return an empty array when the input is empty. This test is important to confirm that the function handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 4: Non-bracket characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function when the input array contains non-bracket characters. The function should ignore these characters and process the brackets correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an array containing both bracket and non-bracket characters.
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned array only contains the bracket characters and they are balanced.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function, which should ignore non-bracket characters. This test is crucial to ensure that the function can handle unexpected inputs and still produce a correct output.
