Scenario 1: Normal operation with balanced brackets

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function with a basic input of balanced brackets. The function should return the same array of strings as the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an array of strings with balanced brackets, such as ["(", ")", "{", "}", "[", "]"].
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the provided array.
  Assert: Assert that the returned array is equal to the input array.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles an input of balanced brackets. This is an important test as it verifies the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Normal operation with unbalanced brackets

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function with an input of unbalanced brackets. The function should return an array with the unbalanced brackets removed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an array of strings with unbalanced brackets, such as ["(", ")", "{", "}", "[", "("].
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the provided array.
  Assert: Assert that the returned array is equal to the balanced array ["(", ")", "{", "}", "["].
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles an input of unbalanced brackets by removing the unbalanced ones. This is an important test as it verifies the functionality of the function in handling incorrect inputs.

Scenario 3: Edge case with empty input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function with an empty input. The function should return an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty array of strings.
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the provided array.
  Assert: Assert that the returned array is also empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles an empty input. This is an important test as it verifies the function's behavior in edge cases.

Scenario 4: Error handling with invalid inputs

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the BracketsFix function with an input of invalid strings. The function should ignore the invalid strings and return an array with the valid ones only.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an array of strings with invalid characters, such as ["(", ")", "{", "!", "[", "]"].
  Act: Invoke the BracketsFix function with the provided array.
  Assert: Assert that the returned array is equal to the array with valid characters only ["(", ")", "{", "[", "]"].
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles an input of invalid strings by ignoring them. This is an important test as it verifies the function's error handling capability.
