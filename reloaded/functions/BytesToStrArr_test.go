ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=BytesToStrArr_a63c34a4a9

Scenario 1: Testing with simple string
Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly converts a byte slice of a simple string into a string slice. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a byte slice that corresponds to a simple string.
    Act: Invoke the BytesToStrArr function with the byte slice.
    Assert: Check if the returned string slice matches the expected string slice.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. It should return a string slice based on the input byte slice. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles simple strings.

Scenario 2: Testing with string containing special characters
Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that contain special characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a byte slice that corresponds to a string with special characters.
    Act: Invoke the BytesToStrArr function with the byte slice.
    Assert: Check if the returned string slice matches the expected string slice.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. It should return a string slice where each special character is a separate element. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles strings with special characters.

Scenario 3: Testing with string containing spaces and newline characters
Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles strings that contain spaces and newline characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a byte slice that corresponds to a string with spaces and newline characters.
    Act: Invoke the BytesToStrArr function with the byte slice.
    Assert: Check if the returned string slice matches the expected string slice.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. It should return a string slice where each word is a separate element and newline characters are also separate elements. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles strings with spaces and newline characters.

Scenario 4: Testing with an empty byte slice
Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles an empty byte slice.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty byte slice.
    Act: Invoke the BytesToStrArr function with the byte slice.
    Assert: Check if the returned string slice is empty.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. It should return an empty string slice when given an empty byte slice. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases.

Scenario 5: Testing with a large byte slice
Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function can handle a large byte slice without running out of memory or taking too long.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a large byte slice.
    Act: Invoke the BytesToStrArr function with the byte slice.
    Assert: Check if the function returns a result within a reasonable time.
Validation:
    The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. It should be able to handle large inputs without running out of memory or taking too long. This test is important to ensure that the function is scalable.
