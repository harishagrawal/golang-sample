Scenario 1: Testing with simple string
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the basic functionality of the function. It will test a simple string to see if the function correctly splits the string into words and punctuation.
Execution:
    Arrange: The byte slice to be tested will be a simple sentence: "Hello, world!".
    Act: Invoke the target function with the byte slice.
    Assert: The expected result is a slice of strings: ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"].
Validation:
    The assertion is checking that the function correctly identifies and separates words and punctuation. This test is important because it verifies the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Testing with complex string
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to handle complex strings. The string will contain multiple types of punctuation and whitespace.
Execution:
    Arrange: The byte slice to be tested will be a complex sentence: "Hello, world! How are you?".
    Act: Invoke the target function with the byte slice.
    Assert: The expected result is a slice of strings: ["Hello", ",", "world", "!", "How", "are", "you", "?"].
Validation:
    The assertion is checking that the function correctly handles multiple types of punctuation and whitespace. This test is important because it ensures the function can handle a variety of inputs.

Scenario 3: Testing with empty string
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when given an empty string. It should return an empty slice of strings.
Execution:
    Arrange: The byte slice to be tested will be an empty string: "".
    Act: Invoke the target function with the byte slice.
    Assert: The expected result is an empty slice of strings: [].
Validation:
    The assertion is checking that the function correctly handles an empty string. This test is important because it ensures the function does not crash or behave unexpectedly when given an empty input.

Scenario 4: Testing with string containing only punctuation
Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when given a string containing only punctuation. It should return a slice of strings containing only the punctuation.
Execution:
    Arrange: The byte slice to be tested will be a string containing only punctuation: ".!?,;:'".
    Act: Invoke the target function with the byte slice.
    Assert: The expected result is a slice of strings containing only the punctuation: [".", "!", "?", ",", ";", ":", "'", "'"].
Validation:
    The assertion is checking that the function correctly handles a string containing only punctuation. This test is important because it ensures the function can correctly identify and separate punctuation even in the absence of words.
