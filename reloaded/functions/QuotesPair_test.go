Scenario 1: No Single Quotes in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns true when there are no single quotes in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array of strings without any single quotes.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Since the function checks for an even number of single quotes and there are none (an even number) in the array, the function should return true. This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where there are no single quotes in the array.

Scenario 2: Even Number of Single Quotes in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns true when there is an even number of single quotes in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array of strings with an even number of single quotes.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Since the function checks for an even number of single quotes and there are an even number in the array, the function should return true. This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where there is an even number of single quotes in the array.

Scenario 3: Odd Number of Single Quotes in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns false when there is an odd number of single quotes in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array of strings with an odd number of single quotes.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Since the function checks for an even number of single quotes and there is an odd number in the array, the function should return false. This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where there is an odd number of single quotes in the array.

Scenario 4: Empty Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns true when the array is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty array of strings.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Since the function checks for an even number of single quotes and there are none (an even number) in an empty array, the function should return true. This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the array is empty.
