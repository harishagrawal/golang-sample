ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=QuotesPair_b16f82413a

Scenario 1: No Single Quotes in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns true when there are no single quotes in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array of strings without any single quotes.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Since the function counts the number of single quotes and checks if it's an even number, an array without any single quotes should return true because zero is an even number. This test checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Odd Number of Single Quotes

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns false when there is an odd number of single quotes in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array of strings with an odd number of single quotes.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The function counts the number of single quotes and checks if it's an even number. Therefore, an array with an odd number of single quotes should return false. This test checks the function's capability to correctly identify an odd number of single quotes.

Scenario 3: Even Number of Single Quotes

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns true when there is an even number of single quotes in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array of strings with an even number of single quotes.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The function counts the number of single quotes and checks if it's an even number. Therefore, an array with an even number of single quotes should return true. This test checks the function's capability to correctly identify an even number of single quotes.

Scenario 4: Empty Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns true when the array is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty array.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The function counts the number of single quotes and checks if it's an even number. Therefore, an empty array should return true because there are no single quotes (zero is even). This test checks the function's capability to correctly handle an empty array. 

Scenario 5: Null Array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a null array.
Execution:
  Arrange: A null array.
  Act: Invoke the QuotesPair function with the arranged array.
  Assert: Assert that the function does not throw an exception.
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle a null array without throwing an exception. This test checks the function's robustness and error handling capability.
