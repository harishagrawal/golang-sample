/*
1. Test when the input string 's' is empty - The function should return false as there are no commands within the empty string.
 
2. Test when the input string 's' doesn't contain any of the commands (up, low, cap, bin, hex). The function should return false.

3. Test when the input string 's' contains one of commands - The function should return true irrespective of the command's position in the string.

4. Test when the input string 's' contains multiple commands (up, low, cap, bin, hex). The function should return true because at least one command is present.

5. Test when the input string 's' contains a command not wrapped in parentheses (Example: "This Cap string"). The function should return false as the regex only looks for commands within parentheses.

6. Test when the input string 's' contains a command within parentheses but interrupted with other characters (Example: "(up_grade) string"). The function should still return true as per the regex, as it tolerates other characters mixed with the command in the parentheses.

7. Test when the input string 's' contains a command in different cases - The function should return true only for lower case commands wrapped in parentheses as per the regex, commands in other cases should return false.

8. Test when the input string 's' is null or undefined. The function might throw an error depending on how the GoLang handles null or undefined values.

9. Test when special characters or numbers are inputted as the string 's'. The function should return false unless the recognized commands are present.

10. Test for long input strings. This tests the efficiency of the regular expressions and whether they can handle long strings without compromizing performance.
