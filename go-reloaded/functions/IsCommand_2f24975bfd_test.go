/*
1. Testing a string that contains the word "up" but is not enclosed in parentheses should return false.
2. Testing a string that contains the word "up" enclosed in parentheses should return true.
3. Testing a string that contains the word "low" but is not enclosed in parentheses should return false.
4. Testing a string that contains the word "low" enclosed in parentheses should return true.
5. Testing a string that contains the word "cap" but is not enclosed in parentheses should return false.
6. Testing a string that contains the word "cap" enclosed in parentheses should return true.
7. Testing a string that contains the word "bin" but is not enclosed in parentheses should return false.
8. Testing a string that contains the word "bin" enclosed in parentheses should return true.
9. Testing a string that contains the word "hex" but is not enclosed in parentheses should return false.
10. Testing a string that contains the word "hex" enclosed in parentheses should return true.
11. Testing a string that contains multiple command words, all enclosed in their own set of parentheses, should return true.
12. Testing a string with command words, where only some are enclosed in parentheses, should return true for the enclosed commands.
13. Testing a string that contains none of the recognized command words should return false.
14. Testing with an empty string should return false.
15. Testing with a string that does not contain parentheses, even if it contains command words, should return false.
16. Testing for case sensitivity, lower case, and uppercase scenarios should return correct values based on case checks implemented in the function.
17. Testing a string that contains the command words but with additional spaces in the parentheses should return true, based on if the regular expression accommodates that. For example, "( up )" instead of "(up)".
