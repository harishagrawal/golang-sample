/*
1. Test with a basic ASCII string:
   Try passing in a string of ASCII characters, and make sure the resulting array is as expected, also check for the special characters included in the conditions of the function.

2. Test with empty slice:
   Try passing in an empty slice and verify that the function returns an empty string array.

3. Test with the string of whitespaces:
   Ensure that the function does not include empty strings in the resulting array when fed with a string of only whitespaces.

4. Test with special characters:
   Pass a string containing only the special characters mentioned in the function and check if they are being separated correctly into each element of string slice.

5. Test with newline and tab characters:
   Try passing a string with newline and tab characters and verify that the function handles these correctly.

6. Test with punctuation inside words:
   Verify that punctuation characters within words are separated out correctly into separate elements in the string array.

7. Test with punctuations at the end of string:
   Ensure the last word of the string and punctuations at the end of string are appended correctly in the output slice.

8. Test with non-ASCII characters or Unicode:
   Try passing in a string of non-ASCII characters or Unicode characters to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

9. Test with strings that only contain numbers or other non-specific characters:
   Test if the function correctly separates numerical values and non-specific characters.

10. Test with very large byte slices:
    Ensure that the function correctly handles larger inputs and look for any performance issues in this case.
