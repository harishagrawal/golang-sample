/*
1. Scenario: Passing an input array which is empty. The function should return an empty array as well.

2. Scenario: Passing an input array where none of the strings matches the condition for (up, hex, bin, low, or cap). The function should return an array that is exactly the same as input.

3. Scenario: Passing an input array of strings wherein one string matches the condition for (up, hex, bin, low, or cap) but there isn't a closing parenthesis ")". In such a case, the function should return an array that concatenates all strings after the matched one until end of array into the matched one.

4. Scenario: Passing an input array of strings wherein one string matches the condition for (up, hex, bin, low, or cap) and there is a closing parenthesis ")". The function should return an array that concatenates all strings between the matched one and closing parenthesis into the matched one and removes all concatenated ones.

5. Scenario: Passing an input array wherein there are consecutive opening parentheses with (up, hex, bin, low, or cap). The function should treat each one separately and performs concatenation operation for each.

6. Scenario: Passing an input array with special characters or whitespaces. The function should process the array normally without throwing any error.

7. Scenario: Passing an input array that includes \n character inside the matching strings (between opening parenthesis and closing parenthesis). The function should handle the \n character and concatenate the following strings correctly.

8. Scenario: Passing an input array wherein multiple strings match the condition (up, hex, bin, low, or cap) and there are corresponding closing parentheses. The function should perform the concatenation operation for each matching pair and return the expected output.

9. Scenario: Passing an input that contains one string which starts with a parenthesis but doesn't contain (up, hex, bin, low, or cap) after it. The function should return the array as it is.

10. Scenario: Passing an input array that doesnâ€™t contain parentheses at all. The function should return the array as it is.
