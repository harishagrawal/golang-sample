/*
Test Scenarios:

1. Scenario when `arr` contains only punctuations. The function should collect and append all the punctuation marks at the end of the previous non-punctuation element.

	Example: ["!", ",", ".", "!"] should return ["", "!", ",", ".", "!"]

2. Scenario where `arr` is empty. The empty slice should be returned as is since there's nothing to process.

	Example: [] should return []

3. Scenario when `arr` contains a mix of punctuations, commands, newlines, and other strings. The function should return the resulting slice after performing the defined operations.

	Example: ["Hello", "!", "World", ".", "\n", "break", ":"] should return ["Hello!", "World.", "\n", "break:"]

4. Scenario when `arr` is a regular sentence split into words and punctuation. It joins the punctuation to the previous word.

	Example: ["Hello", "world", ".", "It", "is", "a", "great", "day", "."] should return ["Hello", "world.", "It", "is", "a", "great", "day."]

5. Scenario where `arr` contains one or more newline characters along with other strings and punctuation. The function should be able to handle and process newline characters in the slice.

	Example: ["Hello", "\n", "world", "!"] should return ["Hello", "\n", "world!"]

6. Scenario when `arr` contains only commands and newlines. The function should leave them as is since these are not punctuations.

	Example: ["echo", "ls", "\n", "mkdir"] should return ["echo", "ls", "\n", "mkdir"]

7. Scenario when `arr` contains a mix of punctuations only. These should all be concatenated to each other.

	Example: [".", "!", ",", "?"] should return [".!,"]

8. Scenario when `arr` contains both punctuation and command inside the string. The function should leave them as is since these are not separate elements.

	Example: ["Hello,world", "echo", "ls", "\n", "mkdir"] should return ["Hello,world", "echo", "ls", "\n", "mkdir"]

9. Scenario when `arr` contains a single punctuation. It should be returned as is.

	Example: ["."] should return ["."]
