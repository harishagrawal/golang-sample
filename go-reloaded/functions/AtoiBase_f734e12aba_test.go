/*
Following are the test scenarios for the AtoiBase function:

1. **Input string and the base are the same**: The function should return the calculated result based on the given string and base.

2. **Test with base length less than 2**: The function should return 0 as we are considering base of at least length 2.

3. **Test with base having repeated characters**: The function should return 0 as base should contain unique characters.

4. **Test with base containing '-' or '+':** The function should return 0, as it is stated that if the base has either '+' or '-', the function returns 0.

5. **Check to validate negative number scenario:** The function should properly return the converted integer value, if applicable, as the '-' sign for integers doesn't seem to be considered by the function.

6. **Test with an empty string 's':** The function should handle this scenario appropriately.

7. **Base string does not contain characters of input string:** For this scenario function should return 0, because no characters from input string, exist in base string. 

8. **Test with large numbers:** Add test cases to ensure the function works properly with large number strings.

9. **Test with non-alphanumeric characters or symbols in input string and base:** The function should handle this scenario and return the appropriate output.

10. **Test with long length string and base:** The function should not hang or crash when handling very long strings and base cases.

11. **Test with zero in the base:** The function should appropriately handle situations where there are "0"s in the base. 

12. **Test with a valid numeric input and base:** The function should return the correct numeric equivalent of the string using the provided base.
