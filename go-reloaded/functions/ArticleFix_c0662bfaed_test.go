/*
1. Scenario: Verify that the function processes an array of strings with no elements that start with [ayeoihAYEHIO].
- Input: An array without any elements starting with [ayeoihAYEHIO].
- Output: The array is returned as is with no changes. 

2. Scenario: Validate the functionality when there are elements that start with any of the listed characters [A,E,Y,E,H,I,O] and the last element in the array is either "a" or "A".
- Input: An array with strings starting with any of these chars[A,E,Y,E,H,I,O] and the last element in array is either "a" or "A".
- Output: The function should append an "n" to the last element of the array. 

3. Scenario: Validate the function against an array that has an element "\n".
- Input: An array with "\n".
- Output: The function should skip the element which is "\n". 

4. Scenario: Validate the functionality when there are elements that do not start with [ayeoihAYEHIO] and the last string is either "an" or "AN" or "An" or "aN".
- Input: An array with strings that do not start with [ayeoihAYEHIO] chars and the last string is either "an" or "AN" or "An" or "aN".
- Output: The function only should return the first character of the last element. 

5. Scenario: Validate the functionality when the array is null.
- Input: Null array.
- Output: return null array. 

6. Scenario: Validate the functionality against a list of strings starting with [ayeoihAYEHIO] and none of them is among these ["a","A"].
- Input: Array of strings none of them starts with [ayeoihAYEHIO] and none of them among these ["a","A"].
- Output: The function should return the array as is. 

7. Scenario: Validate functionality with an array of strings where none of them start with [ayeoihAYEHIO] and the last string is none of these ["an","AN","An","aN"].
- Input: Array of strings where none of them start with[ayeoihAYEHIO] and the last string is not among these ["an","AN","An","aN"].
- Output: The function should return the array as is. 

8. Scenario: Testing the function performance against a large array.
- Input: A large number of strings within the array.
- Output: The function should handle the large input without any runtime exceptions and should return the expected output based on the given conditions.
