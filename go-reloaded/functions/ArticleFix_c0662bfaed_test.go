/*
1. Test with an array that contains some items starting with vowels, where some items are separated by "\n". Verify that the function correctly adds an "n" to the item that follows the '\n'.

2. Test with an array that contains some items starting with consonants, where some items are separated by "\n". Verify that the function correctly removes the "n" from the item that follows the '\n'.

3. Test with an array that contains all items starting with vowels but not separated by "\n". Verify that the function does not alter the original array.

4. Test with an array where no items start with vowels. Verify that the function does not alter the original array.

5. Test with an array that contains a mix of items starting with vowels and consonants. Verify that the function correctly applies the transformations based on whether the array items are preceded by "\n".

6. Test with an array that contains only one item. Verify that the function returns the original array irrespective of whether the item starts with a vowel or a consonant.

7. Test with an empty array. Verify that the function returns an empty array.

8. Test with an array that contains items starting with both lowercase and uppercase vowels. Verify that the function changes the items correctly irrespective of case.

9. Test with an array that contains both lowercase and uppercase "an" or "AN" values. Verify that the function correctly alters these values to their single character counterparts.

10. Test with an array that contains special characters or numeric values. Verify how the function is expected to behave in such scenarios.

11. Test with arrays that contain long strings. This would test the efficiency of the function.

12. Test with an array that contains null or empty strings. The test will validate how the function behaves for these scenarios.

13. Test the function with non-string input. This will ensure the function correctly handles or rejects unsupported data types.
