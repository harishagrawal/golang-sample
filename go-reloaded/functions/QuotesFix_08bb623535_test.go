/*
1. Test scenario when the input array is empty. There are no strings to modify so the output of QuotesFix function should return an empty array.

2. Test scenario when the input array contains no single quotes sting. The output array should be identical to the source array, as no modifications should be made.

3. Test scenario when the input array consists purely of single quotes. Since there are no strings to append to, the expected output would probably only consist of the quotes. Depends on the behaviour of the methods `NewlineAndCommandIndforw` and `NewlineAndCommandIndback`.

4. Test scenario when the input array contains odd numbers of single quotes. The behavior of the function in such a scenario might not be predictable, as it appears to pair off the quotes for processing. Verification required to ensure it handles such conditions properly.

5. Test scenario when the input array contains even numbers of single quotes. The function should process each pair of quotes and modify the strings as promised.

6. Test scenario when all elements in the array are single quotes, except for one or more elements. In such a case, the function should be able to process and modify the strings as expected.

7. Test scenario when the input array contains non-string characters. This would test whether the function is able to handle unexpected types or would it result in an error.

8. Test scenario where the input array is extremely long. This is to check how well the function performs with large amounts of data.

9. Test scenario where the same string is repeated in the array.

10. Test scenario where the array contains strings both with and without quotes.

11. Test scenario where quotes are found in the middle of strings and not as separate elements in the array.

12. Test scenarios with various mixtures of single and double quotes. Check if the function can distinguish between and correctly handle both varieties.

13. Test scenario where the array contains multiple identical elements.

14. Test scenario where the array only contains numbers or special characters except quotes. This will check whether the function can handle non-alphabetic characters.

15. Test scenario where the array contains Unicode or non-ASCII characters. Check the compatibility of the function with various character sets.
