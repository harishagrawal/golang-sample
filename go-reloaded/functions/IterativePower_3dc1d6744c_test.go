/*
 1. Scenario: The 'power' integer is zero.
    Description: The function takes two regular integers as input, 'nb' and 'power', but the 'power' input is zero. Expect the function to always return 1 in this scenario.

 2. Scenario: The 'power' integer is negative.
    Description: The function takes two regular integers as input, 'nb' and 'power', but the 'power' input is negative. Expect the function to return 0 in this scenario.

 3. Scenario: The 'power' integer is positive.
    Description: The function takes two regular integers as input, 'nb' and 'power', with 'power' being a positive integer. Expect the function to return the result of 'nb' raised to the 'power'.

 4. Scenario: Both 'nb' and 'power' integers are positive.
    Description: Both input values are positive integers. Validate that the function correctly computes and returns the result of 'nb' raised to 'power'.

 5. Scenario: Both 'nb' and 'power' are the same positive integer.
    Description: Both inputs are the same positive integer. Validate that the function computes and returns the result of 'nb' raised to the 'power' of itself.

 6. Scenario: The 'nb' value is negative and the 'power' value is positive.
    Description: In this case, test if the program correctly manages the negative 'nb' value, when raised to the positive 'power', following the rules of arithmetic.

 7. Scenario: The 'nb' value is larger and the 'power' value is smaller.
    Description: Validate how the function handles the scenario where the 'nb' value is significantly larger than the 'power' value. Check that it correctly manages computing larger numbers.

 8. Scenario: The 'nb' value is smaller and the 'power' value is larger.
    Description: Validate how the function handles the reverse of the above scenario â€“ where the 'power' value is significantly larger than the 'nb' value.

 9. Scenario: Extremely large 'nb' and 'power' values.
    Description: Test the function's performance and return value when both the 'nb' and 'power' values are extremely large numbers. This test will check if the function can handle such large computations and correctly return the result.

 10. Scenario: 'nb' is 0 and 'power' is a positive number.
    Description: This scenario is to test a corner case, where 'nb' is zero and 'power' is a positive number. The function should return 0 according to the principles of arithmetic.
