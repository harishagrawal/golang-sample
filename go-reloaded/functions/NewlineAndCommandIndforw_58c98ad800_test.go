/*
1. Scenario: Testing when arr is empty.
- Description: The function should return the value of `j` after initialization, which always equals to `i + 1`

2. Scenario: Testing when `i` is bigger than the length of arr.
- Description: The function should return the value of `j` after initialization, which always equals to `i + 1`

3. Scenario: Testing when all elements in arr from `i + 1` to `len(arr) - 1` are '\n'
- Description: The function should return `len(arr)`

4. Scenario: Testing when all elements in arr from `i + 1` to `len(arr) - 1` are results of IsCommand().
- Description: The function should return `len(arr)`

5. Scenario: Testing when one of the element from `i + 1` to `len(arr) - 1` is `'`
- Description: The function should return -1. Also check the boundary condition when `arr[len(arr) - 1]` is `'`

6. Scenario: Testing when one of the element from `i + 1` to `len(arr) - 1` is neither '\n' nor a result of IsCommand().
- Description: The function should return the index of the first such element. Also check the boundary condition when `arr[len(arr) - 1]` is such an element.

7. Scenario: Check a combined case with elements of '\n', results of IsCommand(), `'` and others.
- Description: The function should work properly following the priority order in the function `NewlineAndCommandIndforw`.

8. Scenario: Testing with `i` being negative.
- Description: It is unclear from this function, how to handle negative values. The function currently would return `i + 1`, but the output and handling may differ based on the actual working and requirements in the code/system it is running. This scenario is more of handling possible edge cases.

9. Scenario: Testing with very large array sizes.
- Description: To assess performance or any possible memory issues that may arise. This may not be applicable based on system constraints, but generally it's good to assess.

10. Scenario: Testing when 'i' equals to `len(arr) - 1`
- Description: This should return `i + 1` or `len(arr)` in the current setup.
