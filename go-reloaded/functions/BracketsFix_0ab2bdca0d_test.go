/*
1. **Scenario:** When the input array is empty.
  - **Expected Outcome:** The returned array should also be empty since there are no characters to process.

2. **Scenario:** When the input array only contains one element which is not a bracket or "\n".
  - **Expected Outcome:** The returned array should be the same as input array since there are no brackets to fix.

3. **Scenario:** When the input array only contains one element which is a bracket "(".
  - **Expected Outcome:** Since the function doesn't handle unmatched brackets, the returned array should still contain that single bracket.

4. **Scenario:** When the input array contains a pair of correctly nested brackets, [ ( ] surrounding a command.
  - **Expected Outcome:** The returned array should contain the same structure, as the function doesn't modify correctly nested brackets.

5. **Scenario:** When the input array contains a pair of incorrect nested brackets, [ ) for example.
  - **Expected Outcome:** The function should not be able to fix such situation and return an array contains the incorrect nested brackets.

6. **Scenario:** When the input contains multiple lines, some with correct and some with incorrect bracket nesting.
  - **Expected Outcome:** The returned array should contain the same array for the correctly nested lines, and incorrect nested lines should still remain incorrect.

7. **Scenario:** When the input array starts or ends with a newline character ("\n").
  - **Expected Outcome:** The returned array should contain the newline character at the start or end (as per the input). The function doesn't attempt to move newline characters or process them further.

8. **Scenario:** When the input contains multiple commands, each surrounded by different types of brackets ({command1}, [command2], and (command3)).
  - **Expected Outcome:** The returned array should preserve the different unique command-bracket relationships.

9. **Scenario:** When the input array contains only brackets with no associated commands.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Since the function doesn't handle lone brackets, the returned array should also contain them.

10. **Scenario:** When the input array contains an IsCommand string among brackets.
  - **Expected Outcome:** The returned array should combine that string with the closest previous bracket and delete any newline characters in between.
