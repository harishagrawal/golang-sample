/*
1. Test if the function properly handles a single opening bracket with a closing bracket with no commands in-between.
2. Test if the function handles a case where there are multiple types of brackets, both opening and closing.
3. Test if the function handles a case where the brackets are nested inside another set of brackets.
4. Test a scenario when there are no brackets in the input string array. The function should return the input array as it is.
5. Test the function with a '\n' command in-between opening and closing brackets.
6. Test the function with another command in-between opening and closing brackets.
7. Test with an opening bracket but no closing bracket. The function behavior might be undefined since brackets are not properly closed.
8. Test with a closing bracket but no opening bracket. Again, this might result in undefined behavior since there is no corresponding opening bracket.
9. Test with multiple commands between the opening and closing brackets.
10. Test with empty characters or strings in-between the opening and closing brackets. 
11. Test situation when multiple opening brackets are followed by matching closing brackets directly.
12. Test situation where there are multiple subsequent commands or '\n' characters before a closing bracket.
13. Test when input array is empty. Since there aren't any characters or strings in the array, the output should also be an empty array.
