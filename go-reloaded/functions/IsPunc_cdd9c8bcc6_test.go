/*
1. Scenarios to test when the string input `s` is empty or `nil`. Expected output would be `false`.

2. Scenarios to test when the string `s` consists of standard English alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) without any punctuations. Expected output would be `false`.

3. Scenarios to test when the string `s` contains digits only without any punctuations. Expected output would be `false`.

4. Scenarios to test when the string `s` comprises English words strung together to form a sentence with no punctuation. Expected output should be `false`.

5. Scenarios to test when English alphabets or words include punctuation(s) somewhere in between the letters or words. The expected output in this case should be `true`.

6. Scenarios to test when a string `s` containing punctuation(s) at the start or end of the string. Expected output in this scenario should be `true`.

7. Scenarios to test when string `s` contains only punctuation(s). Expected output in this case should be `true`.

8. Scenarios to test when the string `s` contains words or sentences with newline character `\n` in it. Expected return from the function should be `true`.

9. Scenarios to test when the string `s` contains special characters that aren't considered as punctuation, for example, `@`, `#`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `~`, etc. Expected output in these cases should be `false`.

10. Scenarios to test when the string `s` contains Unicode characters or emoticons. Expected output should depend on whether or not these foreign characters fall into the category of punctuation.

11. Scenarios to test when the string `s` contains whitespaces only. Expected output should be `false`.

12. Scenarios to test when the string `s` is long and contains multiple sentences with punctuation. Expected output should be `true`.

13. Scenarios to test the string input `s` containing escape characters like `\t`, `\r`, etc. Expected output should be `false` as these are not considered punctuations.
