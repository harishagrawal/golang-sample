/*
Test Scenarios:
1. Test with a string that contains punctuation: The function should return true if the string contains any punctuation. For example, "Hello, world!" should return true.
2. Test with a string that does not contain any punctuation: The function should return false if the string does not contain any punctuation. For example, "Hello world" should return false.
3. Test with an empty string: The function should return false when the string is empty.
4. Test with a string that contains only punctuation: The function should return true when the input string contains only punctuation. For example, ".,;:()!?'" should return true.
5. Test with a string that contains special characters other than punctuation: The function should return false when the string contains special characters that are not considered punctuation according to the used regex. For example, "/@#^&*_-+" should return false.
6. Test with a string that contains numbers and punctuation: The function should return true when the string contains numbers and punctuation. For example, "12345,67890." should return true.
7. Test with a string that contains both uppercase and lowercase letters along with punctuation: The function should return true. For example, "Hello, World!" should return true.
8. Test with a string comprising punctuation and whitespaces: The function should return true. For example, ",     .   !    ;" should return true.
9. Test with special unicode characters mixed with punctuations: The function should return whatever result matches the regexp condition.
10. Test with a long string that consists of repeating sequence of alphabet, punctuation and numbers: This is to check how the function handles non-trivial inputs.
