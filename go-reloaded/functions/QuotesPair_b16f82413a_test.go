/*
1) Test Scenario: Empty Array
   Description: Check whether the function handles an empty array correctly. The expected return is true since no odd pair of quotes ever existed.

2) Test Scenario: Array with No Single Quote
   Description: Check how the function behaves with an array having strings without a single quote. Expected behavior is to return true because there are 0 single quotes to pair. 

3) Test Scenario: Array with Strings without a Single Quote and Other Characters
   Description: Check how the function behaves with an array having strings composed of different types of characters but no single quote. Expected result is true because the absence of single quotes should bring counter to 0.

4) Test Scenario: Array with One String Containing a Single Quote  
   Description: Provide array with string containing exactly one single quote. Expected behavior of the function should be returning false, because there's an odd number of single quotes.

5) Test Scenario: Array with Multiple Strings Containing Odd Number of Quotes
   Description: Check the function on array with multiple strings, each holding an odd number of single quotes. The expectations is counter to be an even number and function to return true.

6) Test Scenario: Array with Multiple Strings Containing Even Number of Quotes
   Description: Check the function on array with multiple strings, each holding an even number of single quotes. The expectations is counter to be an even number and function to return true.

7) Test Scenario: Array with Strings Containing Other Special Characters along with Single Quotes
   Description: Test to handle array with strings containing other special characters along with single quotes and whose total single quotes count is an odd number. The expected behavior is to return false. 

8) Test Scenario: Array with Large Number of Strings 
   Description: Test for scalability. Use large number of strings and verify that the function still produces the correct results in reasonable time. 

9) Test Scenario: Array with Long Strings
   Description: Test for scalability by having strings of long length, determine whether the function continues to work as expected.

10) Test Scenario: Non-String Elements in Array
    Description: Check how the function handles array items that are not strings. This could lead to a runtime error, so it's good to test for such cases.
