/*
1. Scenario: Passing array of strings which does not contain any newline or command statement with i initialised at zero, the function should return -1 because it doesn't enter the loop and automatically returns j which is designed to return -1 in this scenario.

2. Scenario: Passing array of strings containing newline or command elements only, the function should return -1 as the loop will continue until j is not greater than 0 and the break condition will never be fulfilled.

3. Scenario: Passing empty array, the function should return -1 as per the initial declaration of j=0 and it will not enter the loop.

4. Scenario: Passing array of strings which contains both newline, commands and other elements with i greater than zero, the function should stop and return the index when it encounters the first string that is neither a newline nor a command, moving from the end.

5. Scenario: Passing array of strings in which the first element is neither a command nor a newline, the function should return 0 as the loop will break at the first instance when the string is neither a newline nor a command.

6. Scenario: Passing array of strings where the strings after ‘i’ index are all newlines or commands, in this scenario the function should return one less than the index of last non-newline and non-command string before the index 'i'.

7. Scenario: Passing an array where 'i' is greater than the length of the array, as it could be possible within the function's definition. The function would then work backwards from the array's end, until it finds a string that isn't a newline or command.

8. Scenario: A single element array where that element is not a newline or command, and i is specified as that index. The function should return the same index, as it is the only element and isn't a newline or command.

9. Scenario: An array where all elements are either newline or command elements and 'i' is initialized greater than 0. The function should return -1, as it will pass through each element and no break condition will meet.
