Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-unit-openai-github using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

1. Test with a string that contains only one word. The function should return a slice with that word only.

2. Test with a string that contains multiple words separated by spaces. The function should return a slice where each element is a word from the string.

3. Test with a string that contains multiple words separated by newlines. The function should return a slice where each element is a word from the string and the newline characters are also included as separate elements.

4. Test with a string that contains a mix of spaces and newline characters as separators. The function should return a slice where each element is a word or a newline character.

5. Test with an empty string. The function should return an empty slice.

6. Test with a string that contains only newline characters. The function should return a slice where each element is a newline character.

7. Test with a string that contains special characters, numbers, and punctuation. The function should return a slice where each element is a word, a newline character, or a special character/number/punctuation.

8. Test with a string that contains multiple consecutive newline characters. The function should return a slice where each newline character is a separate element.

9. Test with a string that starts and/or ends with newline characters. The function should return a slice where the first and/or last element is a newline character.

10. Test with a string that contains words separated by multiple consecutive spaces. The function should return a slice where each element is a word or a space.

11. Test with a very long string. This will test if the function can handle large inputs.

12. Test with a string that contains non-ASCII characters. This will test how the function handles characters outside the ASCII range.
